## 🔍 Project Overview

This project is a **complete end-to-end Coffee Shop Sales Analysis** using a combination of **SQL** and **Power BI**.

### 🧩 Key Workflow Summary:

- 📥 **SQL** is used for data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and implementing business logic.
- 📊 **Power BI** is used to build interactive dashboards and visual storytelling with calculated metrics and insights.

The dashboard evolves from **basic reporting to advanced analytics**, leveraging various techniques such as:

### 🔍 SQL Responsibilities:

- Created the database schema and imported raw CSV datasets into structured tables  
- Cleaned and standardized data by:
  - Removing nulls and duplicates  
  - Renaming columns and changing data types  
- Applied business logic and data transformation using:
  - `GROUP BY`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY` for aggregation and filtering  
  - Conditional logic using `CASE WHEN` for classification and flagging  
  - **Joins** to combine multiple datasets (sales, products, categories)  
  - **Window functions** such as:
    - `LAG()` and `OVER(PARTITION BY...)` to calculate **Month-on-Month** revenue changes  
   


### 📈 Power BI Responsibilities:

- Designed a structured **data model** with star schema and relationships  
- Created **custom DAX measures**, KPIs, and calculated columns for deep analysis  
- Implemented advanced **time intelligence**:
  - Month-on-Month (MoM), daily, and hourly trends  
- Built a completely **interactive dashboard** using:
  - Slicers, action filters, drill-through pages, and tooltips  
- Applied **conditional formatting** to highlight performance metrics dynamically  
- Customized visuals and tables with:
  - Advanced DAX
  - Dynamic titles and chart interactions  
  - Custom table formatting and matrix views  
- Integrated **data mining logic** for pattern discovery and segmentation  
- Delivered a **fully dynamic experience** for business users with actionable insights

This project showcases how raw transactional data can be transformed into powerful, decision-supporting visuals—ideal for management and business stakeholders in retail environments.
